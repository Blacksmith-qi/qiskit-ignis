    r"""
    Reconstruct a quantum state using CVXPY convex optimization.

    **Objective function**

    This fitter solves the constrained least-squares minimization:
    :math:`minimize: ||a * x - b ||_2`

    subject to:

    * :math:`x >> 0` (PSD, optional)
    * :math:`\text{trace}(x) = t` (trace, optional)
    * :math:`\text{partial_trace}(x)` = identity (trace_preserving, optional)

    where:
    * a is the matrix of measurement operators :math:`a[i] = vec(M_i).H`
    * b is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
      :math:`b[i] ~ \text{Tr}[M_i.H * x] = (a * x)[i]`
    * x is the vectorized density matrix (or Choi-matrix) to be fitted

    **PSD constraint**

    The PSD keyword constrains the fitted matrix to be
    postive-semidefinite, which makes the optimization problem a SDP. If
    PSD=False the fitted matrix will still be constrained to be Hermitian,
    but not PSD. In this case the optimization problem becomes a SOCP.

    **Trace constraint**

    The trace keyword constrains the trace of the fitted matrix. If
    trace=None there will be no trace constraint on the fitted matrix.
    This constraint should not be used for process tomography and the
    trace preserving constraint should be used instead.

    **Trace preserving (TP) constraint**

    The trace_preserving keyword constrains the fitted matrix to be TP.
    This should only be used for process tomography, not state tomography.
    Note that the TP constraint implicitly enforces the trace of the fitted
    matrix to be equal to the square-root of the matrix dimension. If a
    trace constraint is also specified that differs from this value the fit
    will likely fail.

    **CVXPY Solvers**

    Various solvers can be called in CVXPY using the `solver` keyword
    argument. See the `CVXPY documentation
    <https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#solve-method-options>`_
    for more information on solvers.

    Args:
        data: (vector like) vector of expectation values
        basis_matrix: (matrix like) measurement operators
        weights: (vector like) weights to apply to the
            objective function (default: None)
        psd: (default: True) enforces the fitted matrix to be positive
            semidefinite (default: True)
        trace: trace constraint for the fitted matrix
            (default: None).
        trace_preserving: (default: False) Enforce the fitted matrix to be
            trace preserving when fitting a Choi-matrix in quantum process
            tomography (default: False).
        **kwargs: kwargs for cvxpy solver.
    Raises:
        ImportError: if cvxpy is not present
        RuntimeError: In case cvx fitting failes
    Returns:
        The fitted matrix rho that minimizes
            :math:`||basis_matrix * vec(rho) - data||_2`.
